For the longest time, the world has been fascinated by the idea of flying cars. Now, it seems, we’re one step closer to reality.

A new report from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the group that represents many of the world’s leading carriers, says that a new form of flying taxi could take to the skies by 2025.

The organization notes that the technology is “already entering the market”, with a new company called Volocopter saying that it will begin testing its air taxis in 2021.

Volocopter is currently working on a six-seater prototype that it hopes will be able to take to the skies in a matter of years.

“The next-generation eVTOL will be a more flexible and robust solution for both urban and regional air mobility,” says Volkmar Klipstein, IATA’s executive director of aircraft operations.

“This opens a wide range of options for new services, with potential benefits for air passengers, cities and the environment.”

A company called Joby Aviation is also developing a passenger aircraft that will have two engines.

“A fully-electric, quiet, highly efficient aircraft will not only be a game-changer for cities, but also will lead the way for a global aviation industry that can lower carbon emissions,” says Joby Aviation CEO Peter Goelz.

“With our new technology, we will be able to develop a fully electric air taxi that will provide affordable, safe, and efficient air travel for everyone, and contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.”

The report also says that flying taxis will be able to carry passengers from one city to another in as little as 20 minutes, with a maximum range of 400 miles.

The report also notes that there are several other companies working on similar designs, including Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls-Royce.

The report also notes that the technology could be a game-changer for cities, with the ability to transport large numbers of people in a short period of time.

The report notes that the new technology could also be used to deliver goods, with the potential for drones to deliver small parcels in minutes.

However, the report also notes that there are a number of challenges facing the new technology, including safety and security concerns, and how the technology will be implemented.

“We need to make sure the technology is safe and secure, and that it meets all the required regulations,” says IATA.

“This includes making sure the</p>
