The future of artificial intelligence in everyday life is a matter for the future of our planet, our future of our children, ours as well as our own.

We can all agree that humans are more intelligent than they are today. However, let's not let that be the case.

The world's top AI companies don't know the difference between human and machine, but let's not pretend for a second that we haven't seen this happen.

While the world's AI companies know just about everything about each and every one of us, the rest of us aren't aware of the difference, and they're certainly not aware of the benefits.

This is all because they can't foresee the future at all.

The future of AI is a matter for the future of our planet, our future of our children, ours as well as our own.

Let's not pretend that we can't see the benefits of AI:

We can see them in their work. We can see them in their products. We can see them in their research. We can see them in their products.

In short, we can see AI as being about the future of human society, our society today.

The question is: how can we see the benefits of AI?
