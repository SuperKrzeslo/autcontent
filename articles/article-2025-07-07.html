  <h1>AI Article (2025-07-07)</h1>
<p>The future of artificial intelligence in everyday life—what we know today about "hardware," for example, and how we might go about solving it—is not clear, but the technology is still evolving.</p>
<p>With machine learning, that means that we are developing more sophisticated applications, and the capabilities we have, and we can do so in ways that we can make our work more effective.</p>
<p>Our future will be better.</p>
<p>I believe that we are on the verge of seeing a new era of human-level artificial intelligence. And so we have to keep fighting. I think for the first time, in the last decade, we have a truly good AI.</p>
<p>And I believe that this is a very good time to be alive.</p>
<p>And I believe that the real danger of AI isn't just that we are dying, we are dying because of it. And that's going to be this year.</p>
<p>And I think that we can do that.</p>
<p>I think that we know the threat is real. And I think that we can do a lot to limit it.</p>
<p>I think that we can do a lot to help our children. And I think our children will be much better off, because we know that we are not going to be afraid to get involved.</p>
